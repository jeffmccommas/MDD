			No doubt I have spent many endless hours mocking up web pages, and as such I have have a good set of re-usable and uniform Web UI elements that I can rely upon to save precious time and spare headaches when I am in the initial stages of a web project. These are some examples of what I have in my  toolbox stored up for projects for my clients. Designed in Adobe Illustrator CS6</p>
