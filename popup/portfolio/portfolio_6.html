		<p>

			This is one of just many sets  of stylish web elements I have created to use with diffeernt projects. With a tool box consisting of many elements I have created over the years it makes it simple to create new designs. This set was created in Photoshop CS6.</p>
		<p>No doubt I have spent many endless hours mocking up web pages, and as such I have have a good set of re-usable and uniform Web UI elements that I can rely upon to save precious time and spare headaches when I am in the initial stages of a web project. These are some examples of what I have in my  toolbox stored up for projects for my cleints.</p>
