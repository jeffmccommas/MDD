		 <span class="category block">WEB DESIGN BUILT WITH HTML5 BOILERPLATE</span>

	     <p>This web site is currently still under development as I'm waiting on the final content for the pages. Why is content always late? But I wanted to show case this theme anyways because it has so many dynamite qualities to show off. Here is what I have done with it:</p>
     <article class="desc">
      <ul>
      <li>Built with the HTML5 Boilerplate Framework using Wordpress Bootstrap responsive framework. This site is fully responsive to all screen sizes and media queries.</li>
      <li>Next I integrated approximately 13 different Jquery library plug-ins to give the site some nice animation and user interactivity.</li>
      <li>Because of so many Java-script HTTP requests I used UglifyJS Java-script minification to minify the files into just one file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Case Study:</strong> The client needed a solution where they could eassily manage the content on there website. The solution was to integrate a CMS sytem and I chose Wordpress as the engine for this project. What the client has now is a fully responsive website using the latest version of Wordpress where they can now easily update any of there pages from a CMS administration tool.</p>
